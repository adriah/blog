I did it! I finally found time to actually put up a blog. As part of loving
the simplicity of the old web and as a avid complainer of how modern websites 
are way to bloated, I've made an attemt at keepubg this blog as simple as 
possible.


Instead of spinning my own theme I ended up using a pre-made one, simpliy because
I found one that had exactly what I needed and nothing else. The styling is simple
and it's one of the few themes out there without any JS. The theme can be found
over at [GitHub](https://github.com/clente/hugo-bearcub)


So what can you expect from this blog? Well... I won't promise too much, but I
will at least try to use it as a personal journal where I share my thoughs and 
notes on everything ranging from how to configure IRC bouncers to why I think
AI right now is just a fad.
