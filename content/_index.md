Admirer of the old web, hater of enshitification and a enthusiastic citizen of 
the internet. This is my personal website, where I on occassion will post stuff
some people might call blog posts. It's really more intended to be a place where
I can jot down notes on everything ranging from guides to thoughts on how our
AI overlords will fail on the journey to one day take over this world and save 
humanity.

I do write code, which can be found at the best source forge out there:

Oh, I live in Norway :norway: which might explain the gloomy mood during winters.
