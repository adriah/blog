      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I did it! I finally found time to actually put up a blog. As part of loving
the simplicity of the old web and as a avid complainer of how modern websites
are way to bloated, I&rsquo;ve made an attemt at keepubg this blog as simple as
possible.</p>
<p>Instead of spinning my own theme I ended up using a pre-made one, simpliy because
I found one that had exactly what I needed and nothing else. The styling is simple
and it&rsquo;s one of the few themes out there without any JS. The theme can be found
over at <a href="https://github.com/clente/hugo-bearcub">GitHub</a></p>
<p>So what can you expect from this blog? Well&hellip; I won&rsquo;t promise too much, but I
will at least try to use it as a personal journal where I share my thoughs and
notes on everything ranging from how to configure IRC bouncers to why I think
AI right now is just a fad.</p>
